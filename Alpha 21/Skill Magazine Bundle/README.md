# Skill Magazine Bundle

Add recipes so you can craft Skill Magazine Bundle.

## What this Modlet does

With this “Modlet” you can craft Skill Magazine Bundle.
You get 3 random sets of 2 skill magazines. The recipe cost is 2100 Duke coins and 60 paper which is the coke of 6 magazines from a trader plus 300 coins to cover the P&P to your door
but that can be changed in the recipe.xml file if you wish.

## Installing

Copy the **Skill Magazine Bundle** folder into the 7D2D Mods folder.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods
```

You may need to create the “Mods” folder if you don’t already have one.
