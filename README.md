## Installing

Download and unzip the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/archive/master.zip).

Copy each modlet folder you want to use into the 7D2D Mods folder.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods

You may need to create the “Mods” folder if you don’t already have one.
