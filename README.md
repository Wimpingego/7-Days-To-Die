# WimpingEgo 7 Days To Die Modlet Mess

I have no clue what I’m doing other than having a bit of fun. You never know if others might want to take a look, so here it is.

Feel free to edit and improve anything you find here.

## Mods

**Egos Zombie Chop Shop** - Time to put them dead Z’s to some good use again

**Egos Ammo Dismantling** - Dismantle your ammo into Ammo Parts

**Egos Pick Me Up** - ‘That would look good in my home. I’m taking it with me!’

## Installing

Download and unzip the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/archive/master.zip).

Copy each modlet folder you want to use into the 7D2D Mods folder.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods
```

You may need to create the “Mods” folder if you don’t already have one.
