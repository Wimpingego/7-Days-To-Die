# 7 Days To Die Modlet Mess

I have no clue what I’m doing other than having a bit of fun. You never know if others might want to take a look, so here it is.

Feel free to edit and improve anything you find here.

## Mods

**[Zombie Chop Shop](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/tree/master/Zombie%20Chop%20Shop)** - Time to put them dead Z’s to some good use again

**[Ammo Dismantling](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/tree/master/Ammo%20Dismantling)** - Dismantle your ammo into Ammo Parts (Old but I will fix bugs if found)

**[Ammo Uncrafting](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/tree/master/Ammo%20Uncrafting)** - Uncraft your ammo but at a cost.

**[Pick Me Up](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/tree/master/Pick%20Me%20Up)** - ‘That would look good in my home. I’m taking it with me!’

**[Unlock The Locked](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/tree/master/Unlock%20The%20Locked)** - Add recipes to items ingame that dont have them.

## Installing

Download and unzip the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/Wimpingego/7-Days-To-Die/archive/master.zip).

Copy each modlet folder you want to use into the 7D2D Mods folder.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods
```

You may need to create the “Mods” folder if you don’t already have one.
