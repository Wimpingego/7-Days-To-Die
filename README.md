# WimpingEgo 7 Days To Die Modlet Mess

### I have no clue what I'm doing other than having a bit of fun.

All of this is real only been made for myself to mess about with but you never know other want to take a look at it so here is what I have so far

```
Egos Zombie Chop Shop - Its time to put them dead Z's to some good use again
Egos Ammo Dismantling - Dismant your ammo in to other types with a little cost
Egos Pick Me Up - That would look good in my home so lets pick one up.
```

### Installing

To us this all you need to do is drop it inside the Mods folder in the root folder of you 7 Days To Die game.
YOu may need to make a folder called "Mods" if you dont already have one.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die
```
