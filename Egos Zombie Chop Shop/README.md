# Egos Zombie Chop Shop

Its time to put them dead Z's to some good use again

## Whats this Modlet does

With this "Modlet" you can harvest Rotting Flesh & Bones from every zombie. Most but not all can drop one or two special items when they are detroysed.

```
Every dead zombie has 200 hit points & stay after get for 100 ticks.

This can be changed along with the dropped items and drop probability in side the entityclasses.xml
```

### Installing

To us this all you need to do is drop it inside the Mods folder in the root folder of you 7 Days To Die game.
YOu may need to make a folder called "Mods" if you dont already have one.

```
