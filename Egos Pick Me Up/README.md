# Egos Pick Me Up

That would look good in my home.

## Whats this Modlet does

Alwasy wanted that one item for you home & do there is no way to craft it well with this "Modlet" you can pick up items/block in the game that you can't normally, as well as craft chain link fences (because I wanted them).

```
The new items you can pick up are:

PoolTable, Park Bench A & B, Bench Press, Picnic Table, End Table, Bed02 (Double bed), Weight Bar
Swing Set, Slide, Treadmill, Stationary Bike, Reptile Terrarium.

You can also rest easy now knowing that you can now pick back up the Barbed Wire Fence, Iron Spikes
Wooden Spikes if like me you always place them wrong.

This items you can be pick up can be changed in side the blocks.xml
```

### Installing

To us this all you need to do is drop it inside the Mods folder in the root folder of you 7 Days To Die game.
YOu may need to make a folder called "Mods" if you dont already have one.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die
```
