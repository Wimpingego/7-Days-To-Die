# Egos Ammo Dismantling

Dismant your ammo in to other types with a little cost

## Whats this Modlet does

With this "Modlet" you can dismant your ammo in to new part items that you can then use to craft other ammo types.

All gun ammo can get crafted into the new "Ammo Part" at a return of 3 for 9mm ammo, 5 for 44 Mag ammo, 5 for 7.62mm ammo and 5 for shot gun shells.

Arrows can be crafted in to the new "Arrow Part" at a return of 3 for Stone, 5 for Iron and 7 for Steel, Flameing and Exploding

Blots are the same as arrows but are crafted in to the new "bolt Part" item

```
The return numbers can be changed along with the recipes costs in side the recipes.xml
```
