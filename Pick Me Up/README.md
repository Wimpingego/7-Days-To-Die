# Egos Pick Me Up

‘That would look good in my home. I’m taking it with me!’

## Whats this Modlet does

Have you always wanted that one item for you home and there is no way to craft it? Well now you can.

With this "Modlet" you can pick up items/block in the game that you can't normally.

The items you can pick up:

* PoolTable
* Park Bench A & B
* Bench Press
* Picnic Table
* End Table
* Bed02 (Double bed)
* Weight Bar
* Swing Set
* Slide
* Treadmill
* Stationary Bike
* Reptile Terrarium

If you're like me, always placing spikes incorrectly. You can also rest easy knowing that you can now pick up the Barbed Wire Fence, Iron Spikes and Wooden Spikes.

The items you can pick up can be changed in the ```blocks.xml``` file.

### Installing

Copy the **Egos Pick Me Up** folder into the 7D2D Mods folder.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods
```

You may need to create the “Mods” folder if you don’t already have one.
