# Egos Ammo Dismantling

Dismantle your ammo in to Ammo Parts.

## What this Modlet does

With this “Modlet” you can dismantle your ammo in to part items that can be use to craft other ammo types.

Gun ammo can be dismantled into Ammo Parts, arrows in to Arrow Parts, and Bolts into Bolt Parts.

The same quantity of Ammo/Arrow/Bolt Parts are required to craft each ammo type, but crafting higher tier ammo items may require additional components such as Scrap Polymers or Animal Fats.
