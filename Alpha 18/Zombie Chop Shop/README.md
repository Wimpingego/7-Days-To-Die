# Egos Zombie Chop Shop

Time to put them dead Z’s to some good use again.

## What this Modlet does

With this “Modlet” you can harvest Rotting Flesh and Bones from every zombie. Some zombie corpses can drop one or two special items when destroyed.

Every dead zombie has ```50 hit points``` and will not despawn for ```100 ticks```.

This can be changed along with the dropped items and drop probability in the ```entityclasses.xml``` file.

## Installing

Copy the **Zombie Chop Shop** folder into the 7D2D Mods folder.

```
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods
```

You may need to create the “Mods” folder if you don’t already have one.
